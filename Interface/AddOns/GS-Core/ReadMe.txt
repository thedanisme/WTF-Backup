===================================
What is GnomeSequencer
===================================

This is a small addon that allows you create a sequence of macros to be executed at the push of a button.

Like a /castsequence macro, it cycles through a series of commands when the button is pushed. However, unlike 
castsequence, it uses macro text for the commands instead of spells, and it advances every time the button is 
pushed instead of stopping when it can't cast something.

This means if a spell is on cooldown and you push the button it will continue to the next item in the list with 
each press until it reaches the end and starts over.

This was originally written by semlar and released at http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23234-GnomeSequencer.html

===================================
What is different on this fork?
===================================
I have extended the original interface to include some help information (/gnome help) as well as extending the 
macro spec to store the following extra information.

  specID = 259,
  author = "Draik",
  helpTxt = "Rogue Assassination Talents: 331232",

Author and HelpTxt are self explanatory but specID is what spec the macro is written for. The list is as below.

The theory is that other authors could add in their macros.

===================================
Making Addon Packs.
===================================
Gnome Sequencer now supports addon packs.  GS-Core will work as it always has but you can create optional addon packs as long as they start with GS- in the name and are set to Load on Demand.

Create a folder called GS-NewMacros
Inside that folder make two files with a text editor:
- GS-NewMacros.toc
- NewSequences.lua

Inside GS-NewMacros.toc:

  ## Interface: 70000
  ## Title: GS New Macros
  ## Notes: A sample random collection of new macros
  ## Author: Draik 
  ## Version: r1
  ## RequiredDeps: GS-Core
  ## LoadOnDemand: 1
  NewSequences.lua

Start the first line of the NewSequences.lua with the following line then continue as before:

  local Sequences = GSMasterSequences

===================================
