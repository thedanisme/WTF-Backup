--------------------

Jim Whitehead:
	- Update for 70100
	- Fix issue with non-titled waypoints
	Thanks to AnrDaemon for the patch, this makes it possible to distinguish
	between waypoints set by TomTom without a title and those set by another
	addon.
	- Enable /wayb to take a name/title as an argument
	If one is not provided, just use the existing behaviour.
