    DBM Timer Trigger: Use "<" as a default remaining comparison operator
    
    That prevents a eror being shown if no operator was selected

    Change many triggers to not automatically hide
    
    If there are two triggers with inverse conditions, e.g. a cooldown
    active + cooldown not active trigger. We ideally want to always have
    exactly one of those auras active. If we automatically hide the
    cooldown active trigger on expiration time, this can be a moment
    before getting the actual event.
    
    So for those triggers where we expect a event, disable the automatic
    hiding.
