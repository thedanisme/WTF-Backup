    Enable remaining time option also for "Always visible" cooldown triggers
    
    That does make some use cases a bit easier, e.g. showing a aura in the
    last few seconds and hiding it once the ability is on cooldown.

    Manually increase frame level for various buttons
    
    I can't reproduce all issues, but users report issues and
    those buttons are in a similar position as the texture select
    button, where I can reproduce the issue.
    
    This is a bug in WoW, this might be revertable with 7.2

    Fix Equiment Slot CD trigger
    
    Since we only get a event on the cd starting, we need to track this
    in a similar way as all other cds.

    DBM Timer Trigger: Use "<" as a default remaining comparison operator
    
    That prevents a eror being shown if no operator was selected

    Change many triggers to not automatically hide
    
    If there are two triggers with inverse conditions, e.g. a cooldown
    active + cooldown not active trigger. We ideally want to always have
    exactly one of those auras active. If we automatically hide the
    cooldown active trigger on expiration time, this can be a moment
    before getting the actual event.
    
    So for those triggers where we expect a event, disable the automatic
    hiding.
