--------------------

Infus:
	- Warrior: Add Arms's Charge and Prot's Shield Block
	- Fix backgrounds of dynamic groups
	The dynamic group first sets all auras to their
	position and then in DoResize finds the max/min xy coordinates
	by iterating over all auras. Somehow, the position in DoResize was
	wrong. Adding debug output directly after setting the position fixed
	it, as does adding a call to GetBottom() directly after SetPoint.
	
	This looks like a bug in WoW to me.
	- Add load conditions to DK talents
	Somehow missed that, probably because I don't play DKs.
	- Add Legendary Item Proc "Kael'thas's Ultimate Ability"
	- Fix wrong load condition in templates for Ancestral Guidance
	- Add UNIT_FACTION event to Unit Characteristics
	To fix not updating WA on changes to UnitCanAttack().
	
	According to https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/issues/1,
	UNIT_FACTION fires for most cases and is the best event to use.
	
	Even though this might not fix it in all cases.
