Infus:
	- Sort the event/status/sound/chat dropdown's list
	By adding a DropDown that automatically sorts the entries. This control is
	just a normal DropDown with a overriden SetList function. The normal
	DropDown can already sort, but due to AceConfig always calling SetList
	with a order parameter set to nil, it never does sort.
	
	The SortedDropDown automatically sorts. Add it to a few places where
	the list is big enough that sorting improves the user experience.
	- Fix Jitter for circular progress
	Since 7.1 the rotation isn't visible until the next frame.
	
	So delay calling SetTexCoordinates until the next frame too.

	- Add a event trigger for spell charges
	Allows for triggering on gaining or loosing spell charges.
