--------------------

Infus:
	- Order the texture pickers's okay/cancel button and the textures
	This feels like a Blizzard bug. Apparently the scroll frame no
	longer clips the mouse interaction. So increase the okay and cancel
	button's frame level to ensure that they are in front.
	- Update Trigger Templates for 7.1
	TODO!!! Add new trinkets, investigate patch notes
	- Fix remaining time check of cooldown progress (item slot)
