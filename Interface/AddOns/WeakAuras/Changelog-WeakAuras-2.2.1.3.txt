--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- pull in latest LibCompress
Infus:
	- Fix regression for Glow Frames
	If the action was enabled, but no frame of that name could be found.
	(Or the frame name was empty.)
	
	Reported in curse comments
	- Fix dynamic groups again by releasing clones at a different place
	A bit of background information:
	Clones are allocated/released to a clone pool as needed so that
	they are reused.
	
	A long time ago, clones were released in a OnHide event handler.
	That was wrong, because e.g. movies hide all regions, and there
	were thus a few bugs where movies would confuse weakauras.
	
	I fixed that by decoupling hiding and releasing, and made WA
	only release the clones if WA is doing the hiding.
	
	In that patch, I misunderstood the interaction with dynamic groups,
	and thus clones from dynamic groups were never released.
	
	A recent bug report reported performance problems, which I tracked
	down to this bug.
	
	This patch now moves the releasing to the right place.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 674, 708
	- Templates: Fix two monk bugs
	Wrong talent on Hit Combo, missing Storm, Earth and Fire.
	- BuffTrigger: Allow auto icons for auras that have spellids
	Ticket-Nr: 381
	- Apply glow to a private frame instead of the frame the user selected
	This fixes a incompability with Bartender, since that uses LBG too.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 677
	- Collapse: Ensure that hideRegion is called
	hideRegion releases the clone. It was only called if there was a
	end animation.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 674
	- Fix custom untriggers for all states functions
	Same logic as for trigger functions.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 604
