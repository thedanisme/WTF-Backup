--------------------

Infus:
	- Make tooltip, blue text, clicking work for multi selection
	Ticket-Nr: 561
	- Options: Ensure that certain ui elements start on a new line
	By inserting a empty description before them.
	
	This can happen if a group has two auras:
	Aura 1, the spec selection is in single selection mode.
	Aura 2, the spec selection is in multi selection mode.
	
	That is if the user selects aura1, the combobox is show,
	the group of checkboxes hidden.
	
	If aura2 is selected, the combobox is hidden and the checkboxes
	are shown.
	
	If now a group of those auras is selected, the "hiddenAll" function
	checks for each widget if the widget is visible for all auras.
	
	=> Both widgets are hidden and no widget is shown in the right column.
	Thus the next widget which should be in the left column is shown in the
	right.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 562
	- Fix changing load conditions for groups is very slow
	Ticket-Nr: 601
	- Totem Trigger: Add icon for inverse
	Inverse requires a totem name, so try fetching the icon from that.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 635
	- Setup the aura_environment before creating fallback state
	Since it could be for a custom function.
	
	Technically not a regression, but surfaced due to a recent change.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 633
