--------------------

Infus:
	- For triggers with automaticrequired, ensure that trigger.unevent is "auto"
	In the attached aura that was attached to the bug report trigger.unevent
	was custom, even though there's code around line 5950 in
	WeakAurasOptions.lua which sets the trigger.unevent on switching to
	a automatic required trigger.
	
	That code works. Importing the aura, switching the prototype away
	and back does fix the users aura.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 667
	- IsSpellKnown Load condition
	- Fix setAll for colors
	In a recent commit to correct how groups and multiselection work,
	I broke that by calling set(info, ..., not before), set gets passed
	only the first value of in ...., but for colors 3 values need to be
	passed.
	
	So special case multiselection, and only pass the third value in
	for multiselection.
	
	The reason we need to pass in the third value for multiselection,
	is that the set functions for multiselections by default only toggle
	a value. If different auras in a group had different initial values,
	toggling them leads to interesting behaviour.
	- Adjust templates to Divine Stead changes
	It's now baseline
	- Text display type: Change initial value from "New" to %p
	That's probably more useful.
	- Icon: Fix not displaying any text without %
	Ticket-Nr: 663
	- Apply glow effects even if squelching actions
	Ticket-Nr: 641
Benjamin Staneck:
	- move the old Tutorials modul into it's own repo
	https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAurasTutorials
Infus:
	- Add in Combat Condition Trigger
	Trivial to add, and more flexibel than a load condition. The Conditions
	already react to PLAYER_REGEN_(ENABLED|DISABLED)
	
	Ticket-Nr: 656
	- Fix group auras after closing Options
	Closing the options would not correctly update the group auras
	if not in a group at all and only group auras where used.
	
	Noticed while fixing related bug.
	- Remove recent_chages code from BuffTrigger.lua
	This caused some auras to not show up on loading.
	
	In the bug reports case, the code was tracking buffs only
	outside of combat.
	
	The sequence of events:
	- Apply the buff
	- Enter combat, unloading the aura
	- Leave combat, loading the aura
	
	Loading a aura causes a ScanAll(), in the bug reports case
	this would call AssertAura, but due to the data being identical
	to the data gathered before combat, the aura_cache would indicate
	no change. Yet, after a load we want to update everything.
	
	I think this has been always broken, as I don't recall changing this
	logic.
	
	The fix is, ignoring whether the aura_cache already knew that buff.
	Since the return value of AssertAura/DeassertAura is the only place
	where recent_changes is used, purge it from everywhere.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 645
	- Never disable icon/choose icon in the icon options
	They are hidden if the icon is on automatic mode.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 649
	- Don't call ReplacePlaceHolders if there can't be any text replacemnet
	- Add a valuesAll function that combines the values() functions
	Ticket-Nr: 621
