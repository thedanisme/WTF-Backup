--------------------

Infus:
	- Monk Templates: Fix Sheilun's Gift and Spinning Crane Kick
	Ticket-Nr: 713
	- Fix glow effects again
	On login squelch glow effects for hide actions, but allow glow
	effects for show actions.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 700
	- Run CheckCooldownReady also on talent changes
	We don't get any of the other events in those cases, but e.g. the
	amoung of charges can change. I think this used to work in Warlords.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 704
Benjamin Staneck:
	- if there is no state, just return false instead
	- fix error when converting an aura from one type into another
