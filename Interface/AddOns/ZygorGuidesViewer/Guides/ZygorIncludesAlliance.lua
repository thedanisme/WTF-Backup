		_Avoid beams of light_ until they start pulsating, then you will need to touch one
		This will spawn an Avenging Angel. _DPS these to half health_ and run to Ahoo'ru when they channel. This will break one charge of the shield
		For phase two, _interrupt Complete Heal_ and _run out of Divine Circle_ while avoiding the white orbs
		Use cooldowns wisely during this phase to mitigate damage and burn him down
