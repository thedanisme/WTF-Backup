Your biggest challenge will be catching the things, since they can fly faster than your eagle does. The preferred prey will be the wyrms who are either roosted on the mountains and rocks or are attacking rhinos. If you find one of those, they're easy pickings. They melee and have a weak frost breath attack, but are no threat to your eagle. If you can't find any who are roosted or distracted, you can catch the fliers by heading them off.
