|BOSSID|76877| |LVL|103| |NAME|Grull| |MAPID|988| |ST|(npc:76877) is a simple and straightforward single-target encounter, About 30 seconds into the fight, and approximately every minute thereafter, (npc:76877) will cast (spell:155330), which will choose a handful of random players in the raid (5 in 10-player raids, scaling up to 10 in a 30-player raid).<br/><br/>Another central mechanic of the new (npc:76877) encounter is (spell:155080). When (npc:76877) reaches 100 Rage, he will attack a tank with this ability, dealing an extremely large amount of damage that is split evenly between all players in front of (npc:76877), and debuffing all affected players with a moderate DoT.<br/><br/>(npc:76877) will also aim (spell:155301) at random players, which creates a narrow fissure in the ground in front of him and will knock back and deal heavy damage to any player caught in its effect.<br/><br/>About two minutes into the fight, and approximately every two minutes thereafter, (npc:76877) will enter a (spell:155539), becoming untankable and casting four back-to-back (spell:155301)es. Players must try to avoid damage from these, as this should be a low-damage period to allow healers to catch up on tank and raid healing.<br/><br/>(npc:76877) also attacks the tanks with (spell:155078), which deals heavy damage to all players within 10 yards and leaves them more vulnerable to further (spell:155078) damage. Tanks must make sure that this attack does not happen while (npc:76877) is faced into the raid for (spell:155080); by taunting quickly or rapidly moving to drag (npc:76877) away from the raid as soon as (spell:155080) occurs.<br/><br/>Finally, (npc:76877) will frequently cause (spell:173192) near random players in the room, causing a small zone of lingering AoE damage. Players must move out of the (spell:173192) without jeopardizing their ability to soak (spell:155080).| |DPS|<b>Use DPS cooldowns at the start of the encounter; movement becomes more hectic later on<br/><b>Stack on or near other players in your assigned location to ensure you split (spell:155080) damage<br/><b>Move away from (spell:173192) locations<br/><b>Sidestep (spell:155301)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage| |TANK|<b>Typically keep (npc:76877) faced away from the raid to prevent excessive (spell:155078) damage<br/><b>Face (npc:76877) towards a group of players for (spell:155080), and be sure to alternate groups for each cast of (spell:155080)<br/><b>Tanks should taunt off one another at 2-3 stacks of Inferno Strike initially, then after (spell:155078) falls off thereafter<br/><b>Use strong survivability cooldowns for late applications of (spell:155078), when stacks are high<br/><b>Move out of (spell:155301), particularly during (spell:155539)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage| |HEAL|<b>The (spell:155080) group will take heavy damage as Slice occurs, and lingering DoT damage after; be sure to top players up before their next (spell:155080) soak<br/><b>Tanks will take increasingly heavy damage leading up to (spell:155539), and may need CDs when their (spell:155078) stacks are high<br/><b>Players struck by (spell:155301) or (spell:173192) will take heavy damage and will need emergency healing<br/><b>Players who do not spread out properly for (spell:155330) will inflict heavy damage on all nearby allies<br/><b>Damage reduction CDs should be used to mitigate (spell:155080), especially if there is a mistake and one group takes two in a row<br/><b>Healing throughput CDs should be used to top players up after (spell:155330) or (spell:155539) before the next (spell:155080), or to recover from a failed (spell:155330)<br/><b>Stack on or near other players in your assigned location to ensure you split (spell:155080) damage<br/><b>Move away from (spell:173192) locations<br/><b>Sidestep (spell:155301)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage|
