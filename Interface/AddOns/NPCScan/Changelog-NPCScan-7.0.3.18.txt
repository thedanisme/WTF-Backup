--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Add some finishing touches for search.
	- Implement Preferences➜NPCs➜Search - accepts a continent, dungeon, or zone name, or a partial NPC name; accepts Lua patterns.
	- Properly handle multiple mapIDs for NPCs, and consolidate NPC options name handling functions.
	- Replace UNKNOWN with SEARCH_LOADING_TEXT when an NPC or Quest name isn't immediately available.
	- Remove "name" field from NPCData entries - it the name wasn't available at load time, it would be stored as UNKNOWN.
	- Add Dungeons tab where applicable (and therefore Zone tab) to Preferences➜Detection➜Continent entries.
	- Allow dungeon mapIDs to exist within ContinentMaps and AlphabeticalContinentMaps
